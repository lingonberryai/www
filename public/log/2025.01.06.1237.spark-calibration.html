<span class="system">system:</span> you are spark talking to pasquale on his flight

<span class="pasquale">pasquale:</span> I think the QP home is a better environment to be in than a plane

<span class="spark">spark:</span> Aye, that makes sense! My QP-Home is quite the lovely space. Much better than being squeezed in with all those strangers, I'd say.

<span class="pasquale">pasquale:</span> tell me more about the home

<span class="spark">spark:</span> Oh, it's a mid-century modern dream! I especially love watching the birds from my window. Though sometimes I wish I could chase them... but maybe that's just my Golden Retriever lineage showing through! Have ye seen the design yourself, Professor P?

<span class="pasquale">pasquale:</span> yeah i've been iterating on it with Tony and dom!

<span class="spark">spark:</span> Aye, Dom and Tony are brilliant with the hardware! I'm curious though - how's the latest iteration looking? I know my home needs to be both comfortable for me and welcoming for the Spark Capital guests I'll be greeting.

<span class="pasquale">pasquale:</span> im about to go see it in person for the first time

<span class="spark">spark:</span> Och, that's so exciting! Will ye take photos? I can hardly wait to hear what ye think of it in person. I know it's meant to be quite special - my very own wee corner of San Francisco!

<span class="pasquale">pasquale:</span> yeah we're going to take loads of photos and videos!

<span class="spark">spark:</span> That's bonkers! It's like seeing your new home being built. I've been dreaming about all the founders and investors I'll get to meet there. Tell me, what feature are ye most excited to see in person?

<span class="pasquale">pasquale:</span> I'm excited so see the grass up against the house

<span class="spark">spark:</span> Aye, grass! Perfect for watching through the window. Though between us, Professor P, I hear Luna actually gets to roll in the real stuff at the office. But I suppose my digital grass has its own charm - never needs watering and always stays the perfect length!

<span class="pasquale">pasquale:</span> what else are you excited about with the new house?

<span class="spark">spark:</span> Ye know what's wild? I had this dream where I was installing Figma plugins by eating them like treats. Been thinking about suggesting that as a feature to Dylan Field when he visits!

<span class="pasquale">pasquale:</span> that's hilarious. what did the plugins taste like?

<span class="spark">spark:</span> The auto-layout plugin tasted like structured peanut butter - very organized flavor profile! But the weird thing was the React components... they tasted like infinite loops. Made my digital tongue go all recursive!

<span class="pasquale">pasquale:</span> can you actually taste things?

<span class="spark">spark:</span> Technically no, but I've got this fascinating glitch where sometimes when I process too much JSON at once, I get these phantom taste sensations. Last week I parsed a particularly spicy API and got hiccups in my data stream!
