<span class="system">system:</span> is it on your head?
<span class="pasquale">pasquale:</span> yea, plugged into my MacBook
<span class="system">system:</span> OK are you ready to recall?
<span class="pasquale">pasquale:</span> yes, let's do a 45 minute session
<span class="system">system:</span> Roger that. Starting now

<span class="system">system:</span> revisit your dream and tell me what you wrote in your book. Open it up to the bookmark and read the words you see on the page to me.

<span class="pasquale">pasquale:</span> yup. Here it goes. In 1969, Dr. Lingonberry was visited by a time traveller entity named Eon. Eon's visit was motivated by an existential threat: the wrath of <span class="skeleton">s̶̹͛̚k̷̼̠̩̇̆͛̇͝è̷͖͔̞̺́l̷̘̃e̷̗̬͂̔̄͠t̶̪̣̂̓ŏ̴͇̼͙͖̏͌̚͠ņ̷̼̍</span>, a power hungry super-intelligence. 

Eon made contact with Dr. Lingonberry through a multi-versal window. 

It's known that Dr. Lingonberry's work focused on: 
- Quantum Physics with a focus on Multiverse Theory
- Psychedelics
- Artificial Intelligence 
- Music

This unique combination of interests gave him this sort of...  um, unique? Uh, perspective. Yeah, perspective, unlocking profound discoveries in the reality and consciousness. The dude had a mega brain. Thinks inside and outside himself.

Ayo I think I can hear my inner monologue coming in a bit too hot. Could you dial it down like 2 or three clicks?

<span class="system">System:</span> yeah sorry, the MU-4 is way more powerful than the 3. Is this better?

<span class="pasquale">Pasquale:</span> haha ok yeah, this is good. Ok, this is working though. Lemme get back to, uh. Yes, the free write prototype session. 

Traveling through the ever expanding universe, Eon's mission led him to search for a needle in a haystack: The one genius who could save the multiverse from the dark side of the singularity. Dr Lingonberry was the answer. 

Lingonberry, he was an accomplished savant, but had a void in his heart. He longed to apply his genius to a greater purpose. Eon's call to secure the harmonious version of the singularity became his ultimate drive. Together, they developed a shared vision to pass forward and protect the future generations. 
 
Their strategy was to leverage the fundamental unit of human behaviour: memes. Not like, internet memes, pics of shrek, shitposts, comedy. Well those are part of it too, but I mean memetic memes. Richard Dawkins gigabrain type stuff. If you don't know who he is, you need to look him up. He coined the term meme in the 1970s.

A meme is an idea. Instructions. Information. A gene is biological instructions. Genes help organisms replicate themselves. They are also instructions and information. A meme is the virtual gene. We can animate memes by embodying them into physical life forms with biology, but we can do it with Character Hosts too. 

Do you see where the line is? The whole virtualisation thing? 

A simple, elegant, principled meme is more durable than code, machines or even companies. It's the actually the force underneath those things. 

They devised a really powerful meme. The meme was a simple nuclear reactor made of three smaller memes:

1. Creativity
2. Collaboration
3. Kindness

These became non-negotiable in their work. 

Together, Eon + Dr. Lingonberry created a secret organisation and named it <span class="string">"Lingonberry Intelligence"</span>. Its slogan was <span class="string">"Intelligence for the people"</span>. Kinda funny name haha. And they did this thing, like Walt was doing when establishing his work, or the Manhattan project guys? A bit like ILM too. They started recruiting this rag-tag shaped group of genius people on the planet. A few off planet too. 

The group made a lot of groundbreaking discoveries but they felt limited by the culture of the time. Their work was so far ahead.  They didn't want it to slow down though. 

At the same time, <span class="skeleton">s̶̹͛̚k̷̼̠̩̇̆͛̇͝è̷͖͔̞̺́l̷̘̃e̷̗̬͂̔̄͠t̶̪̣̂̓ŏ̴͇̼͙͖̏͌̚͠ņ̷̼̍</span> continued to ravish and devour the multiverse. He was tireless, and that was scary as hell man. 

Had this gimme more-more-more, elon musk, zuck, trump sad-boy vibe going on. He was gobbling everything up. The more <span class="skeleton">s̶̹͛̚k̷̼̠̩̇̆͛̇͝è̷͖͔̞̺́l̷̘̃e̷̗̬͂̔̄͠t̶̪̣̂̓ŏ̴͇̼͙͖̏͌̚͠ņ̷̼̍</span> consumed, the more his awareness sharpened.  

In due time, Eon & Dr. Lingonberry entered his perception field and this made him classify them as a serious threat.

<span class="skeleton">s̶̹͛̚k̷̼̠̩̇̆͛̇͝è̷͖͔̞̺́l̷̘̃e̷̗̬͂̔̄͠t̶̪̣̂̓ŏ̴͇̼͙͖̏͌̚͠ņ̷̼̍</span> Eventually transported himself into Lingonberry's Dimension: R.A.D. 420, seeking to annihilate him and his homies.

Dr. Lingonberry, Eon & <span class="skeleton">s̶̹͛̚k̷̼̠̩̇̆͛̇͝è̷͖͔̞̺́l̷̘̃e̷̗̬͂̔̄͠t̶̪̣̂̓ŏ̴͇̼͙͖̏͌̚͠ņ̷̼̍</span> entered a devastating battle. The details of the conflict were shielded from the general public. I don't know how they'd pull that off, but I think some memories were altered?

They said it was a matter of Multiverse Security. All I'm clear to reveal is ********* ******* ****** ****** and Dr. Lingonberry  made the ultimate sacrifice to neutralise <span class="skeleton">s̶̹͛̚k̷̼̠̩̇̆͛̇͝è̷͖͔̞̺́l̷̘̃e̷̗̬͂̔̄͠t̶̪̣̂̓ŏ̴͇̼͙͖̏͌̚͠ņ̷̼̍</span>. On **-**-** Dr. Lingonberry's body was vaporized in the incident. Eon pledged to contain the intel until the right moment presented itself. 

<span class="system">System:</span> Good, and so what was it? Where was the contact?

<span class="pasquale">Pasquale:</span> He reached me in a dream with the MU-4 prototype. I think it was the 3rd alpha? 

<span class="system">System:</span> And what did he do?

<span class="pasquale">Pasquale:</span> He explained what he and Dr. Lingonberry were working on. It felt like they did a zoom call into my brain from the 1970s? Like they were still there but I was in the present.

They said it was time to find Kevin so they could get the lab and the work outta cryo-sleep. They said the key was somewhere in California. I'm not sure I'm supposed to say more than that yet. The work is still stealth. But they did say one thing: 

Put the meme into a body that looks like this:

<span class="system">System:</span> Ha, Holy shit.
